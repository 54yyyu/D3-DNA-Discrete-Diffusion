This repo contains a PyTorch implementation for the paper [Discrete Diffusion Modeling by Estimating the Ratios of the Data Distribution
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16834) by [Aaron Lou](https://aaronlou.com), [Chenlin Meng](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chenlin/) and [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/).

## Design Choices

This codebase is built modularly to promote future research (as opposed to a more compact framework, which would be better for applications). The primary files are 

1. ```noise_lib.py```: the noise schedule
2. ```graph_lib```: the forward diffusion process
3. ```sampling.py```: the sampling strategies
4. ```model/```: the model architecture

## Installation

Simply run

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

which will create a ```sedd``` environment with packages installed. Note that this installs with CUDA 11.8, and different CUDA versions must be installed manually. The biggest factor is making sure that the ```torch``` and ```flash-attn``` packages use the same CUDA version (more found [here](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention)).
